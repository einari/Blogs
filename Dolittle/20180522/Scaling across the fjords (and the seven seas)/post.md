# Scaling across the fjords (and the seven seas)

At Dolittle we've set out to make software development more predictable and easier to deliver quality in a continuous manner.
With our frameworks and operational platform on top we aim to take away the biggest infrastructural burdens people building
software has to deal with in order to deliver business value. Not an easy task to take on and do well and keep respecting the
possibilities and choices developers want to do. Taking away freedom is often the price of being able to deliver on such a tough
promise. It is a balance - one we struggle with on a day to day basis; when do we abstract away something - when is the
abstraction too much and you end up creating something way too generic. At the heart of delivering business value sits the
ability to be able for a developer to express the domain they're working in - this is what we focus on. Everything else becomes
secondary when this is the focus. But still, you can't take away all freedom just to do this - its too much of a sacrifice.
As a guiding start; we then lean towards principles and proven software practices that we believe in. I digress.

We're working a lot with the maritime industry and as many other industries, this industry is in the midst of a period of
digitalization. It is one of those buzz-words people talk about, but it has substance behind it. With a history of manual
routines, a lot of paperwork there is a great potential for increased efficiency. On top of this, shipping has a substantial
carbon footprint and [new rules](http://gcaptain.com/shippings-2020-low-sulphur-fuel-rules-explained/) that would add 25% to the
total fuel cost. The numbers for the industry are staggering and opens up opportunities to be more efficient on fuel, but also
other things.

## Software to the rescue?

How could software play a role in this?

For a lot of the digitalization processes its quite obvious that there are some great opportunities for making things more
efficient. With [tens of thousands of vessels](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264024/number-of-merchant-ships-worldwide-by-type/) only in the merchant fleet, you can
quickly see that getting rid of a lot of the paperwork would save a substantial amount for the industry.

New opportunities in using new technology, for instance the [Smart Ropes project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDQ5PjDRk50) that we've been involved with can also be part of the equation, and also save lives at the same time.

On ships there are a lot of these opportunities, they are already equipped with sensors for quite a few things - but
purposed only for telemetry, not to add intelligence based on the data collected.

If we go back to the fuel element, which is the most costly part of shipping - and quickly becoming more costly. What could
be done to save on fuel and how could software make a difference. Looking at the hull alone, a clean hull has less resistance
in water than a dirty one. Combined with weather - going around bad weather, creating optimized routes could also play a role.
Together with Microsoft, Cisco and Wilhelmsen - these are some of the things we are looking into into a project we've
appropriately named "Occasionally Connected Fuel Efficient Vehicle".
