# Inception

Dogfooding is a fairly common term in software, it speaks about an organization using its own products to build other products.
At Dolittle we've taken this concept to the extreme. Not only are we dogfooding ourselves like we're doing with our frameworks,
but we are at every level reusing what we build to build towards an other level of abstraction or build a specific product, which is
most likely going to be used again.
