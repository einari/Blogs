Why talk about it as a journey? Its a job, you might proclaim. Well, sure; it is a job. But I would like to
think that it differs from a lot of other jobs. Not just technically as in there is a difference between different
professions, but even within the software industry - I like to think that working at Dolittle is different.

Let me get back to the journey part later, as I really want to make this post focus on something else.
We're now a year into this *journey* and I want to share my perspective on that. If I were to sum up the first year
in one word; it would by **lucky**.

I feel lucky to...

## ... work with the best team

I know everyone says this; but we truly have got the best team for the start of our *journey*.
Culture at any workplace is by far the most important thing you have. It is the reason people enjoy going to
work.

If you have bad culture, its just not as motivating going to work. And the job becomes just that; a job.
Being a startup, we'd have to discover our culture as we've moved along. It is something we keep a close eye
on - some times more than other times.

Recently we had an internal workshop with an external facilitator and at the end of the workshop I got reminded how
awesome our team is when the person said that he had been observing us throughout the day and he found one thing
he had never witnessed anywhere; there were no egos in the room. To me thats a massive testament to how
great our team is.

I'm so lucky to be part of this team.

## ... truly put that dent in the universe

Democratizing

## ... be able to be part of solving real world problems

## ... have people that believes in us

Our *journey* started with someone believing in the message we have. This belief is what got us the funding.
Dolittle is a joint venture with [Wilhelmsen](https://www.wilhelmsen.com) and the founders, without people
believing in us we'd never get this funding. In addition to that, customers who took a chance and believed in
us has kept us going. I feel very humble on behalf of Dolittle to have gained the trust of those believing in
us. We are not going to let you down. It is crucial to have people around you that believes in what you're
doing, it is what makes you thrive and motivate you to take it to the next level. At the same time, it
should never be a blind trust - we want to constantly challenged.

## Being a startup

The concept of a startup is not new to me; in fact I've mostly worked at startups since the beginning of my
career in 1994. But they are all very different in all aspects except for one thing; hunger. If you want to
succeed at a startup, or in fact at anything; you have to be hungry. You have to want more and not settle for
status quo! It is the belief of making a difference, making something different - something great that gets
me going. And this is the thing that has been in all startups I've worked at. 

To keep this hunger, one needs to stay curious and creative. Thats where a balanced team of people comes into 
play; play on the difference between the team members.

In fact you should completely embrace it, make your work environment a safe place
for speaking ones mind - everyone should park their egos. Its the thing that will keep new ideas flowing.
