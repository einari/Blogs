Journey? Its a job, you might proclaim. Well, sure; it is a job. But I would like to
think that it differs from a lot of other jobs. Not just technically as in there is a difference between different
professions, but even within the software industry - I like to think that working at Dolittle is different.

Let me get back to the journey part later, as I really want to make this post focus on something else.
We're now a year into this *journey* and I want to share my perspective on that. If I were to sum up the first year
in one word; it would by **lucky**.

*I feel lucky to...*

## ... work with the best team

I know everyone says this; but we truly have got the best team for the start of our *journey*.
Culture at any workplace is by far the most important thing you have. It is the reason people enjoy going to
work.

If you have bad culture, its just not as motivating going to work. And the job becomes just that; a job.
Being a startup, we'd have to discover our culture as we've moved along. It is something we've gradually grown
into spending more and more clock cycles on. One thing we've had since the beginning is our own Teams Channel
on culture - where we discuss the topic.

Recently we had an internal workshop with an external facilitator and at the end of the workshop I got reminded how
awesome our team is when the person said that he had been observing us throughout the day and he found one thing
he had never witnessed anywhere; there were no egos in the room. To me thats a massive testament to how
great our team is.

I'm so lucky to be part of this team.

## ... truly put that dent in the universe

The *journey* we're on is all about creating the right toolbox to put developers in the pit of success.
We use this message: "Empower developers to create great, sustainable, maintainable software so that they
can make their users feel like heroes."

This is all about democratization. Creating software that will live for years is hard to do, or at least
if you want something that is evergreen in the sense that the software is easily maintainable over time
and is considered great by the end users all the time. This is what Dolittle is all about, providing
developers with a toolbox that is a combination of Dolittle technology and Dolittle providing the glue
that makes it simpler to do end to end software.

Our goal is to enable every developer out there in making technology accessible to everyone.

This is what we call **"Equalizing the playing field"**.

## ... be able to be part of solving real world problems

At the heart of everything we do is a principle of keeping ourself grounded and honest. We are not building tools
just for the sake of the tools, we are building the tools we build with a foundation in real world needs.
Sure, some of these needs are identified by ourselves. Both from past line-of-business application development
experience we all have in the team, but also from needs we have today.

The way we keep the focus on building the right thing is to make sure what we have gets used in real world applications
as soon as possible. We thrive on feedback and work hard to keep the feedback-loop as tight as possible.

We're lucky as an organization to be doing both our own product development and be part of product development
for customers, delivering real world solutions through our **Customer Success Unit**. This is a great opportunity
for us to understand the needs and challenges being faced in software development. Over the last year, we've
gradually gotten better at understanding this opportunity and making it part of our process. Moving on, we've
established a daily routine that will make this even easier to capture - so that we deliver the right thing.

## ... have people that believes in us

Our *journey* started with someone believing in the message we have. This belief is what got us the funding.
Dolittle is a joint venture with [Wilhelmsen](https://www.wilhelmsen.com) and the founders, without people
believing in us we'd never get this funding. In addition to that, customers who took a chance and believed in
us has kept us going. I feel very humble on behalf of Dolittle to have gained the trust of those believing in
us.

We are not going to let you down. It is crucial to have people around you that believes in what you're
doing, it is what makes you thrive and motivate you to take it to the next level. At the same time, it
should never be a blind trust - we want to be constantly challenged. Keep us on our toes and honest.

## Being a startup

The concept of a startup is not new to me; in fact I've mostly worked at startups since the beginning of my
career in 1994. But they are all very different in all aspects except for one thing; hunger. If you want to
succeed at a startup, or in fact at anything; you have to be hungry. You have to want more and not settle for
status quo! It is the belief of making a difference, making something different - something great that gets
me going. And this is the thing that has been in all startups I've worked at.

To keep this hunger, one needs to stay curious and creative. Thats where a balanced team of people comes into
play; play on the difference between the team members.

In fact you should completely embrace it, make your work environment a safe place
for speaking ones mind - everyone should park their egos. Its the thing that will keep new ideas flowing.

## The Journey

What is this *journey* you speak of, you might be asking yourself.
We call it a journey because its very much a journey of discovery. Our foundation of principles leads us away
from building more of the same. The typical n-tier architecture approach and the focus on typical "forms over data"
that is often found in software development, especially line-of-business applications is not something we believe
is the best approach.

We find comfort in principles like CQRS, EventSourcing, SOLID, Separation of Concerns,
Domain Driven Design, Microservices. And we've chosen to make this our core.

Democratizing a new approach to software development that enables software to be build in a very different way means
we have to understand the implications of making the principles mentioned approachable.

This means providing not only the programmatic APIs that makes it simple to do these things, but also discover
a whole set of tools that there are no references to yet. This is were our journey begins.

On top of this, we're doing a lot of effort in providing predictable workflows and hosting environments for this.
And also discovering how it all fits together holistically with different interaction layers, such as web, mobile,
desktop APIs, bots and more.

An Important aspect for a lot of the customers we see is also to be able to create digital twins, to better
monitor and operate physical equipment. Democratizing this involves understanding how to provide developers with
the right toolset to be able to do this easily as well.

This is what we mean by the *journey*. Inventing the next generation toolchain that will empower developers to
deliver more business value.

## In closing

Its now one year since our [first Dolittler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vidar-aune-westrum/) walked in the door.
A year later the team consists of 10 awesome people.

It has truly been an awesome year. Sure, we've had our ups and downs. Whats more important is that we've
taken the downs and learned from, gaining more knowledge and improving how we work - improving our culture.
We don't consider things as failures, but rather as great ways to gain insight on how we can improve.

I'm super excited about the foundation we've build in the first year and can't wait to see what 2019 has in store
for us.

Happy new year to all Dolittlers, partners, customers, our board - and everyone else!
We're really excited about the future and what it holds.
